/*Players and Cards

Players: Four players form two fixed partnerships (partners sitting opposite—North/South versus East/West).
Card setup: Although a full 52-card deck is used, only 32 cards (A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7 in each suit) are used for gameplay.
Scoring tokens: The other 20 cards serve a different purpose—they're scoring tokens.
One player (say North) manages the black tokens (2-6 of clubs and spades).
The opponent (say West) manages the red tokens (2-6 of hearts and diamonds).
The other two players (South and East) collect tokens from these supplies during the game.
Key point: Black and red tokens never mix; they move strictly between designated players.
Deal and Making Trumps

Dealing:
The dealer rotates each hand.
After shuffling, the dealer offers the deck for a cut to the left-hand opponent.
Each player first receives 4 cards.
Choosing trumps:
The player to the dealer’s right (the one who first gets 4 cards) examines their hand and unilaterally chooses the trump suit.
After that, the dealer gives a second batch of 4 cards, so everyone ends up with 8 cards total.
Play

Starting the trick:
The trump-chooser (player to the dealer's right) leads with any card.
Following suit:
Play proceeds counter-clockwise. Every player must follow the suit led if they can; if not, they can play any card.
Winning a trick:
If no trump is played, the highest card in the suit led wins the trick.
If one or more trumps are played, the highest trump wins.
Continuing play:
The winner of each trick collects the cards (stacked face down) and then leads the next trick.
Scoring

Counting tricks:
After all 8 tricks are played, teams count their wins.
Token transfers:
If the team that chose trumps wins 5-7 tricks, they earn 1 token from the opponents.
If the opposing team wins 5-7 tricks, they get 2 tokens.
Sweeping all 8 tricks (called Kapothi, or Basthe in the south) nets 3 tokens.
If each team wins 4 tricks, no tokens change hands—but an extra token is carried over to the next hand when a team later wins more than 4 tricks.
Game end:
The goal is to be the first team to collect 10 or more tokens.
A team loses if they run out of tokens or can't pay the tokens due.
Tactics

Choosing trump:
Generally, you should choose the suit in which you hold the most cards.
However, if two suits are tied and one contains the ace, it might be smarter to pick the other suit because the ace is likely to win tricks regardless.
Partner play:
Always keep track of what cards have been played and cooperate with your partner.
Avoid “stealing” a trick that your partner is likely to win.
Discarding strategy:
If your partner wins a trick and you can’t follow suit, consider discarding a card from a suit you’d like your partner to lead next. This could be a suit where you have the highest remaining card or where you plan to trump later.
Finessing:
When holding an ace and queen in a suit, sometimes playing the queen first (a finesse) can be beneficial, especially if the opponent to your left holds the king.
Dealing with mixed hands:
If you have one card from each suit, choosing trump is mostly a game of chance.
Some players pick the suit of their lowest card, or even choose a suit in which they have no cards at all, hoping to either get trump cards in the next deal or rely on partner support.*/
