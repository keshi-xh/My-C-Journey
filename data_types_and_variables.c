/*so i did learn data types in here from the site ok*/
/*so integers are defined using char, int, long, long long and short*/
/*then there is unsigned integers i hope it means what means so basically if we define 'a' as an int */
/*i think that's how it works then there are floats defined using float and double */
/*what does double me, no clue*/
/*#define BOOL char
#define FALSE 0
#define TRUE 1
for this also i have no much clue*/
