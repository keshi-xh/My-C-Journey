"Hello, GitHub!" 
i have no clue ok
so i will be like updating this everyday if possible
let's see how far i will go 
so i found this site https://www.learn-c.org 
and i will be following it ok 
first i thought it will be easy using chat gpt
but then i thought to find a book(PDF) somewhere
couldn't find then found the site
so how i do this is i read and do the exercise in that site and then kinda copy and paste the code back to vs code to create the file and then update it at the end of the day
it's pretty nice having chatgpt it helps a lot
